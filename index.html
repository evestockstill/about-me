            I have a dog name Isla, she is one of my most favorite things. 
            I got Isla when she was 8 wks old and we have been hanging for the last five years.
            Isla makes a very good adventure partner! We took a long 6 month road trip
            together. She loves to camp too! A few of Isla favorite things are swimming, 
            chasing her ball although she won't give it back without a treat. Isla also likes to 
            snuggle and chill after she has swam, camped, or chased the ball.

            I love to go camping! I took a long trip with the dog Isla and
            I try to sneak away whenever I get the chance even if it is just overnight.
            After years in the service industry it was a great way to escape and recharge.

          Playing pool is another one of my favorite things. After a 
          hiatus I have been playing more lately. My dad got me into the poolhall so 
          I have been playing for over 30 years and have played in some professional tournaments.
